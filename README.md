# playlist-creator

This project makes use of JS, bootstrap html, css and spring boot to handle interfacing with the database.

To get the database running, you need to have a local instance of MySQL running.

Once you've checked that this is done. Proceed to run the build of the application avaliable as the jar file from this repository.

After this open the html file inside the static folder using live server in vs code. 

Once this is done you'll have access to the website and as such the api within it.
